`apportion` provides different apportionment methods for allocating
seats across states. These methods are also sometimes used for
allocating seats by votes in proportional representation systems.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `apportion` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github('christopherkenny/apportion')
```

## Example

`apportion` has several apportionment methods, each of which take two
required arguments: - `size`: the number of seats to apportion across
units - `pop`: a vector of population sizes for each unit

``` r
library(apportion)
## basic example code
data('state_2020')

app_adams(size = 435, pop = state_2020$pop)
#>  [1]  7  1  9  4 50  8  5  2 27 14  2  3 16  9  4  4  6  6  2  8  9 13  8  4  8
#> [26]  2  3  4  2 12  3 26 14  1 15  5  6 17  2  7  2  9 37  5  1 11 10  3  8  1
```
